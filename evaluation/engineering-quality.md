## 2. Backend Test Suite Breakdown (`pytest backend/tests/`)

Executed on Python 3.11.9 with pytest 8.2.2. All 148 tests passed cleanly in 29.09 seconds.

| Test File | Tests Passed | Subsystem Under Test | Key Assertions & Scenarios |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_api.py` | **27** | FastAPI REST Gateway | Input validation bounds, query length guards, pagination limits, `/compare` error handling, OpenAPI schema compliance. |
| `test_evaluation_metrics.py` | **3** | IR Metrics Engine | Mathematical correctness of P@k, DCG/NDCG formulation, MRR rank discounting, and unjudged result safety. |
| `test_index_lifecycle.py` | **6** | OpenSearch Lifecycle | Timestamped index creation, bulk document streaming, mapping registration, and atomic alias swapping. |
| `test_nlp_semantics.py` | **21** | NLP Pipeline | Entity extraction, brand detection (Compliments, PC), intent classification, and query interpretation. |
| `test_normalizers.py` | **9** | Query Normalization | Spelling typo correction (`protien` $\to$ `protein`), operator spacing, and symbol stripping. |
| `test_nutrition.py` | **16** | Nutrition Parsing | Structuring raw nutrition payloads, per-100g normalization, and physical limit validation. |
| `test_nutrition_ranking.py` | **6** | Directional Ranking | Sorting by directional nutritional criteria (lowest sugar, highest protein) with BM25 tie-breaking. |
| `test_pipeline.py` | **2** | Ingestion Engine | Batch streaming via DuckDB cursor, Pydantic `RawProduct` instantiation, and NaN sanitation. |
| `test_query_engine.py` | **17** | Query Engine | Recipe quantity extraction (`250 g`, `500 mL`), numeric threshold bounds, and dietary flag extraction. |
| `test_ranking.py` | **8** | BM25 Retrieval | Tiered weights: phrase match (10.0 boost), AND match (5.0 boost), and fuzzy match (0.5 boost). |
| `test_retrieval_quality.py` | **4** | End-to-End Retrieval | Precision and recall bounds across sample product documents. |
| `test_search.py` | **4** | Search Router | Parameter routing, filter clause construction, and pagination math. |
| `test_search_engine.py` | **9** | Repository Layer | DuckDB and OpenSearch repository abstraction interfaces and error handling. |
| `test_settings.py` | **4** | Configuration Guards | Pydantic validation: rejection of wildcard CORS in production, mandatory TLS, and credential checks. |
| `test_synonyms.py` | **12** | Canadian Synonyms | Canadian retail synonym mapping (`soya` $\to$ `soy`, `yogourt` $\to$ `yogurt`, `kraft dinner` $\to$ `macaroni and cheese`). |
| **TOTAL** | **148** | — | **100% Passed (0 Failures, 0 Regressions)** |

> [!NOTE]
> **Test Environment & Clean-Machine Reproducibility**:
> The 148 passing backend tests (172 total across both repositories) were verified in the populated development environment where the canonical dataset artifact (`data/raw/normalized.parquet`) is in place.
> 
> On a fresh clone without the Parquet dataset, executing `pytest backend/tests/` yields **143 passed / 5 failed** tests because 5 retrieval/pipeline tests directly depend on reading the Parquet file from disk. Decoupling data-dependent tests using synthetic test fixtures is an active engineering follow-up so that 100% of unit tests can pass out-of-the-box on clean machines.

## 3. Frontend Test Suite Breakdown (`vitest run`)

Executed using Vitest 4.1.11 and JSDOM. All 24 tests across 5 test suites passed.

| Test File | Tests Passed | Subsystem Under Test | Key Assertions & Scenarios |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/tests/badges.test.ts` | **2** | Visual Badges | Nutri-Score (A to E) badge generation, color mapping, and NOVA group formatting. |
| `src/tests/productCard.test.ts` | **6** | Product Card UI | Card rendering, macro-nutrient pills, image fallback handling, and bookmark actions. |
| `src/tests/client.test.ts` | **5** | API Client | REST client request building, timeout handling, error serialization, and CDN URL normalization. |
| `src/tests/assistantService.test.ts`| **4** | OffBot Assistant | Deterministic question evaluation, Nutri-Score explanations, and ODbL citation construction. |
| `src/tests/components.test.tsx` | **7** | Presentation UI | `ErrorBoundary` recovery, `SearchBar` debouncing, `Pagination` boundary conditions, and `EmptyState` rendering. |
| **TOTAL** | **24** | — | **100% Passed (0 Failures, 0 Regressions)** |

## 4. Static Analysis & Type Checking

### Python Backend Linting (`ruff check backend`)
- **Tool**: Ruff 0.5+
- **Result**: `All checks passed!` (0 lint errors, 0 style warnings).
- **Enforced Standards**: PEP 8 formatting, unused import elimination, strict type annotation preservation, and exception chaining hygiene.

### Frontend Type Safety (`tsc -b`)
- **Tool**: TypeScript Compiler (`tsc` 6.0+)
- **Configuration**: Strict mode enabled (`noImplicitAny: true`, `strictNullChecks: true`).
- **Result**: 0 type errors. The frontend TypeScript interfaces strictly mirror backend Pydantic models.

### Frontend Production Bundling (`vite build`)
- **Tool**: Vite 8.1+ / Rollup
- **Result**: 1,863 modules transformed cleanly in 4.45 seconds. All production chunks are gzipped and code-split by route.

## 5. Security & Operational Hardening

### Input Validation & API Defense
- **Query Length Restriction**: Query strings longer than 500 characters are rejected with HTTP 422 to protect regex engines from ReDoS attacks.
- **Pagination Boundary Guards**: Page size is capped at 100 items; offsets cannot exceed 10,000 to prevent deep-pagination memory exhaustion.
- **Comparison Size Limits**: The `/compare` endpoint accepts a maximum of 50 product barcodes per request.

### CORS & Secret Handling
- **CORS Restriction**: Wildcard origins (`*`) are disallowed when credentials are enabled. In production, explicit trusted origins must be declared in `ASKOFF_CORS_ORIGINS`.
- **Zero Hardcoded Secrets**: All OpenSearch credentials, hosts, and paths are injected via environment variables (`.env`).
- **Sanitized Errors**: Exception stack traces and internal database error payloads are stripped before error responses are sent to the client.

### Container Security
- **Unprivileged Execution**: The backend container runs under `appuser` (UID 10001), preventing root privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
- **Healthcheck Probes**: Native container health checks verify service liveness via `GET /health` every 30 seconds.
